## Bug Reporting
Before anyone ever creates feature requests for a plugin they dearly love, they may often find that some aspects of the plugin are faulty and do not work properly.
In HeadsPlus, it is fairly common to find a problem, as the plugin covers so much it proves difficult for me to inspect every single element before I push updates.
This is often by I push fixes for smaller issues on Github first rather than immediately to Spigot so major influxes in updates are avoided.

### Version checking
Before you report an issue, the best practise is to ensure that you are running the latest version of HeadsPlus. 
If not and the newer versions may fix your problems, please do update your HP version; you will need to check on both [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/headsplus-1-8-x-1-15-x.40265/) and [Github releases](https://github.com/Thatsmusic99/HeadsPlus/releases)

If your problem is a critical one that opens up exploits, it is recommended that you temporarily downgrade until your problem is fixed.
See further down below for handling critical bugs.

### Checking open issues
You will also need to check that the issue you are reporting has not already been reported. Thankfully, there aren't often a massive amount of
bug reports in the issue tracker for HeadsPlus, so it should not be a task to take a quick browse and see if your problem is there.
